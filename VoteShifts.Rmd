Estimate the vote transitions using a recursive method developed by [Andreadis](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17457280902799089) (An R script and the [instructions](http://www.polres.gr/en/vtr) are also made available):

```{r, results="hide"}
source('VTR.R')
mydata <- read.csv("data/TR_11_15.csv")
myN <- mydata[7]
myT <- mydata[2:6]
myX <- mydata[8:12]
z<-multirate(myN,myX,myT,0.001);
write.csv(z$Bb, file="data/TransitionRates.csv")
```
And here is the result:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
z$Bb
```
Party names not succeeded with a year are 2015 results. So this vote transition algorithm thinks that 3.2% of CHP11 votes moved to HDP in the 2015 elections.
